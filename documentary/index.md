# @depack/render

%NPM: @depack/render%

`@depack/render` is Renders JSX To String. This is a fork of [developit/preact-render-to-string](https://github.com/developit/preact-render-to-string/) with the new pretty algorithm that breaks up attributes by the line length rather than printing them on each line. It also removes dependency on the Facebook's package for JSX printing that cannot be in _Preact_, so the `/jsx` is currently not implemented.

```sh
yarn add -E @depack/render
```
